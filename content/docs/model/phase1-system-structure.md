## Phase 1: System Structure

### Basic Structure

Use the C4 architecture model: a system having (software) components and interacting via APIs with the outside world.

#### System Context

#### Containers

#### Why not the rest?

The C4 model has two further layers: Components and Code.

You may choose to use these other layers of the C4 model. But they are not as relevant for the enterprise landscape. You may also have a different method of designing and modelling software architecture.

Much more relevant is the fact that you may not have this information, if you are using proprietary software. A software vendor may even try to keep you from discovering the C4 containers, e.g. in hardware appliances. But in order to ensure control over the communication intersection (TODO: ref, definition) of your overall landscape, you must force vendors to give you this information.

### Using the information

#### Generate the Communication Intersection
