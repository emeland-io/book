# Common Elements of Model Objects

All Elements of the abstract models are Reference Objects as defined by the DDD book[^ddd], unless noted otherwise. Therefore each element will have a) an UUID as unique identifier and b) a display name, to help humans identify the element. These to attributes are not shown in the diagrams in this chapter, as they are primarily a technical details. 

See the [Chapter on the example reference](/docs/example-mapping/) for an example on how to map the abstract EmeLand model to a useable data model.
