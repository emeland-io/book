# Introduction

## What is EmELand?

An Enterprise Architecture is intended to align and coordinate the IT landscape of a business with its business processes, in order to most efficiently support said processes and facilitate communication of vital information between different parts of the enterprise.


## What is the archetype of your business?

1. Hyperscaler: your central product is IT infrastructure and the processes with operating and maintaining that infrastructure. If you have higher value services e.g. databases or stream processing, they can only be as good as the infrastructure services that you are providing. Should the infrastructure fail, your costs of downtime are only compounded by your higher layer services.

2. IT Products: even if you offer your product in the form of a cloud service, it is the features of the database, log aggregator, security scanner, API gateway/catalog, AI API, etc., not the infrastructure it runs on.

3. Non-IT Products: anything else, even if highly IT bound like banks or insurance company, your business process uses the IT only as a means, not the core capability of your organization.

## Why you may not need the EmELand

If you already have a working Enterprise Architecture and are satisfied with the insights it provides, then you have already implicitly solved the problem EmELand addresses. There is no benefit gained from changing a working system.

## Principles

* Automation is non-negotiable
