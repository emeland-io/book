# Introduction

## What is EmELand?

The Emerging Enterprise Landscape is an abstract model to structure the data needed to manage a complex integrated enterprise IT landscape.

It defined abstract data objects, their relationships and semantics for manipulation of the created model. This model can then be queried for information about the IT landscape to support efficient management of the landscape itself as well as the digitized business processes that rely on this landscape.

### Why do we need another abstract data model?

An Enterprise Architectures are intended to align and coordinate the information technology (IT) landscape of a business with its business processes, in order to most efficiently support said processes and facilitate communication of vital information between different parts of the enterprise.

But depending on the type of your organization, the processes of your business are not supported by all of the IT you are managing. In an organization that provides IT products, some of the systems in you landscape may be part of the product, some parts may support commercial organization. Only the latter should be considered part of your Enterprise Landscape, while the former are either part of your production management system or customer service data, depending on the type of product. The former only generates deliverables and measurement data, but are not part of your core business process, but rather an input to it.

The differentiation may be appear overly pedantic, but not taking separate view points will result in miscommunication and mode confusion between the business management and product management departments of your organization.

## What is the archetype of your business?

 

- **Hyperscaler**: your central product is IT infrastructure and the processes with operating and maintaining that infrastructure. If you have higher value services e.g. databases or stream processing, they can only be as good as the infrastructure services that you are providing. Should the infrastructure fail, your costs of downtime are only compounded by the downtime costs of your higher layer services.

- **IT Products**: even if you offer your product in the form of a cloud service, it is the features of the database, log aggregator, security scanner, API gateway/catalog, AI API, etc., not the infrastructure it runs on.

- **Non-IT Products**: anything else, even if highly IT bound like banks or insurance company, your business process uses the IT only as a means to an end, not as the core capability of your organization.

## Why you may not need the EmELand

If you already have a working Enterprise Architecture and are satisfied with the insights it provides, then you have already implicitly solved the problem EmELand addresses. There is no benefit gained from changing a working system.

## Principles

* Automation is non-negotiable
